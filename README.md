# javaDiscordBotTest
A bot to monitor a Minecraft server in Discord using the [Java Discord API](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA).
## Current WIP, Version 0.1.2
Current functionality is limited to displaying "IDLE" on the bot's game status. 
Consider this current version an initial basis for the project.

## Configuration (Coming Soon)
Use the example_config.json to setup your bot token and server credentials. Plugin functionality is TBD.
